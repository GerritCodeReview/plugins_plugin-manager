There was only major.minor and not major.minor.fix version.\n\nAck.\n\n\u003e Next question, should this be 3.2 next week after 3.1 is released?\n\nThat\u0027s the thing: it will still be 3.1, because that\u0027s the way the \u0027master\u0027 version will still identify in terms of its version string.\n\nWe don\u0027t have a \u0027master\u0027 version label and there is no reliable way to understand if you are on master or not.\n\nP.S. This is branch stable-2.16, so it is unlikely that someone would install the plugin-manager of v2.16 on v3.1 and then even complain that isn\u0027t doing the proper thing. So I guess on stable-2.16 we\u0027re good anyway.",
