      "message": "I do not believe this to be true, all of the current maven builds, build correctly witht the version number on the end - its part of the maven standard build process.  E.g. look at the current github maven build which works.  The only reason that it works, is that you are looking for the first hyphen, actually the jars are called github-plugin-\u003cversion\u003e.jar and github-oauth-\u003cversion\u003e.jar.\n\nhttps://gerrit-ci.gerritforge.com/view/Plugins-stable-3.9/job/plugin-github-mvn-stable-3.9/\n\nAs such I want a simple change that works with all of the current maven builds without changing all of the current maven builds.  I believe it would be incorrect to prevent normal maven behaviour, simply to allow this bug in the fixMavenName method to continue.\n\nThe alternative would be to name the ai-code-review plugin to ai_code_review but again, I think this wouldn\u0027t be correct.\n\nI believe the suggested fix, applies to all maven builds equally and fixes them using the simplest approach which is falling back to the available reponame which is in a more predictable naming convention and has no version number.",

      "message": "Ideally I think we could have added a new field \"e.g. name\" just like how we obtain the \"description\" from the google repository build url and therefore build name.\nTo be honest even the repo name looks to be what is u sed e.g. github as its useful when grouping more than one jar to a common name e.g. github-plugin and github-oauth dont appear as 2 assets, they appear as one grouped by the repo name. \n\nAs I wanted to reduce the risk here, I kept the previous split logic and use it in most csaes and as all fallbacks conditions, with the only exception being for more complex named hyphenated repos / plugins.",
